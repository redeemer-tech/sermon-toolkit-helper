# Sermon Guide Helper

Sermon Guide Helper is a Streamlit application that helps you turn a sermon audio file into a usable set of resources for your ministry:

1. **Accurate Transcript** – audio → text via OpenAI Whisper.
2. **Small-Group Toolkit** – summary, discussion questions & scripture appendix generated by ChatGPT.

The toolkit can be downloaded as Markdown (for further editing) or as an RTF document (ready to drop in Google Docs/Word).

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Password protection | The whole app is protected by a password set in `.env` ( `APP_PASSWORD` ). |
| Audio transcription | Upload an `mp3`, `wav`, `mpeg` or `m4a` and the app returns paragraph-formatted text. |
| Copy / Download transcript | Transcription is displayed in a large text box (easy to copy) and can be downloaded as **.txt**. |
| Customisable toolkit prompt | The default prompt is editable before each generation so you can fine-tune tone or structure. |
| Toolkit generation | Uses `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` to craft the toolkit from the prompt & transcript. |
| Copy / Download toolkit | Toolkit is shown in a text area (copy-able) and downloadable as **.md** or **.rtf**. |

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file (or set environment variables another way):

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
APP_PASSWORD=choose-a-good-password
```

Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

Visit the local URL printed by Streamlit and log in with the password.

## Deploying

Because the app needs two secrets (`OPENAI_API_KEY` and `APP_PASSWORD`) you must set them wherever the app is hosted (Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, etc.).
